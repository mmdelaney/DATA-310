# Exercise 1

1. Maroney explains that in traditional programming, programmers write code that outlines a set of rules that are followed but input data in order to output answers to a problem.  Machine Learning is a reorientation of this classic model.  In Machine Learning, instead of figuring out the rules to answer a problem, programmers input large amounts of data and answers so that a machine can figure out the correct set of rules.  For example, Maroney uses the example of training a smartwatch to recognize unique activities like walking, running, and biking by having individuals wear a smartwatch and identify the correct label of their activity so that the machine can learn the patterns of each activity in order to predict them in the future.  

2. When I change the predict function to output for the value of 7, the output was 22.00301.  When I re-run the model and predict the output value of 7 again, the output was 22.000021.  Even though both of these values are extremely close to 22, they are slightly different.  This is because neural networks are structures to make predictions based on probabilities since there are no set parameters, like in traditional programming.  Therefore, since we can only teach our models based on a limited amount of data, this leaves open the possibility for the model to interpret the data slightly differently each time.
