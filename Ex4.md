### What is the purpose of using a 3x3 filter to convolve across a 2D image matrix?

### Why would we include more than one filter? How many filters did you assign as part of your architecture when training a model to learn images of numbers from the mnist dataset?

## MSE

### From your 400+ observations of homes for sale, calculate the MSE for the following.

  #### *The 10 biggest over-predictions*
  #### *The 10 biggest under-predictions*
  #### *The 10 most accurate results (use absolute value)*
  #### *In which percentile do the 10 most accurate predictions reside? Did your model trend towards over or under predicting home values?*
  #### *Which feature appears to be the most significant predictor in the above cases?*
  #### *Stretch goal: calculate the MAE and compare with your MSE results*
